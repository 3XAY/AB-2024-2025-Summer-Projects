# 2024-2025 Summer Projects for Ayan Bindal

This repository serves as documentation for my summer projects. The README.md has a short summary of each goal while the [Wiki](wikiURLHere) has more information. This is also useful due to the version control features.
__This is documentation with version control for my summer projects.__


## Dependencies
- FTC SDK Version 9.0.1

## Correctional Movement using the CenterStage Robot
Using the parallel and perpendicular goBILDA encoders on the robot and the Robot Controller's built-in IMU, I will correct erroneous robot movement.

## Driver feedback class + Prototyping tools
This is a simple class that allows for extremely fast driver feedback implementation paired with a Java-based AND Python-based prototyping tool, allowing to you code the driver feedback features without access to the Robot / Robot Controller / Driver Station.

## Code SpeedTest
A simple class that allows you to paste one line of code into your programs. It will measure the "tick-rate" of your program (cycles per second) and can be useful in finding pieces of code that hold the entire program up. (Ex. Subsystems holding up the Drivetrain)
